Writing a Custom Check for Error Prone in Bazel
===============================================
for an in-depth tutorial: http://errorprone.info/docs/plugins

1. Find a built-in check to copy & follow the pattern outlined in the custom check. Save the java file.

2. Modify the BUILD file in your project and ADD the following:
   java_plugin(
    name = "MyCustomCheckPlugin",
    srcs = ["MyCustomCheck.java"],
    deps = [
        "//third_party/java/auto_service",
        "@error_prone//jar"
    ],
   )

   where you replace the name with the name of your plug in, srcs with the java file name, and fill in dependencies with the 
   file names of the dependent items.

3. Build Bazel and it should now run your custom check against the source code in the project file

Note: To disable a check, just delete the corresponding java plug in line from the BUILD file.
