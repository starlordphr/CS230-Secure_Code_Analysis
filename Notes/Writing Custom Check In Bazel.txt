Writing a Custom Check for Error Prone in Bazel
===============================================
for an in-depth tutorial: http://errorprone.info/docs/plugins

0. Apparently there's a bit of setup? https://github.com/google/error-prone/wiki/For-Developers

1. Find a built-in check to copy & follow the pattern outlined in the custom check. Save the java file.
   a. Your Java Class must extend BugChecker but it is advised that it implements one of the templates. 
      E.g. BugChecker.MethodInvocationTreeMatcher
   b. Override the methods for the respective template. Also make sure you place the appropriate warning & name for the 
      checker in the @BugChecker section

2. Modify the BUILD file in your project and ADD the following:
   java_plugin(
    name = "MyCustomCheckPlugin",
    srcs = ["MyCustomCheck.java"],
    deps = [
        "//third_party/java/auto_service",
        "@error_prone//jar"
    ],
   )

   where you replace the name with the name of your plug in, srcs with the java file name, and fill in dependencies with the 
   file names of the dependent items.

3. While still in the BUILD file, modify the java_library to add your plug in like the below:
   java_library(
    name = "customTest",
    srcs = ["customTest.java"],
    plugins = [":MyCustomCheckPlugin"],
   )
   

4. Build Bazel and it should now run your custom check against the source code in the project file

Note: To disable a check, just delete the corresponding java plug in line from the BUILD file.
